# {{ page.title }}

We've received an application, that's great! We now want to decide if the likelihood of candidate â€“ role match is strong enough for us to invest time on the first call and a task.

## What does the candidate do?

## What do we do?
<aside>We've recently set up this process in an applicant tracking system (opting for TeamTailor), but were previously taking notes in a master spreadsheet.</aside>


## Who does what?

At Edurio, this is typically done by the Operations Team, but the criteria should always be discussed with the team leads. They should also sense check the outcomes after a few CVs have been screened.

<aside>"Who?" is the element that's changed the most as we've grown. We've moved from "founders do everything" to "team leads do this now" to "we now have an Ops Team to help".</aside>

For our "first" roles (e.g. first copywriter, first architect, etc.), we expect the team leads to have a much greater involvement than the Operations Team, as it requires domain expertise, not just implementation.

## How to perform well?

The most important thing we're looking for is seeing how your past experience and skills match the needs of the role. Clear, brief CVs + a couple of sentences that allow us seem to work best.
