## First chat

The first chat is the second major filter of the hiring process. It is also the most important one, because candidates passing this stage will be invited to complete the hiring task â€” a time-consuming commitment for them and for us.

We aim to learn a few critical pieces of information in this chat: Is there a match between the candidate's motivation and what we have to offer? Is there a match on values and Have they understood the role accurately? What about the weird pattern / red flag X that we saw in the CV?

**How?**

## Tasks

Nothing provides clearer signals about a candidate's ability to do work than seeing them do work. And, keeping a neat little symmetry, nothing says more about a workplace than seeing how they communicate about work. The task is the tool with the best signal-to-noise tool ratio at our disposal, and it should both be informative and generate a solid basis for a conversation during the interviews.

**How?**

When designing a task, it's important to abstract yourself from an exam mindset â€” you are not evaluating a "right" or "wrong" approach to do things. Instead, you want to have a task that is:

-   Challenging enough
-   Reasonable in length â€” both for the candidate and yourself**.** We are aiming for all the tasks to be reasonably completable in around 4 hours of work, so we don't exploit folks' spare time unnecessarily. Also â€” you will be providing feedback to all candidates, including those that are not moving to the next stage in the interview process, so you better don't exaggerate the amount of stuff.

Generates conversation. Unless, of course, you require punctuality.

**Who?**

Crafting the task is exclusively on the Team Leads (they know our expectations best!), and the Operations Team is extremely helpful in tracking the process and nudging people (both candidates and Team Leads) about progress.
