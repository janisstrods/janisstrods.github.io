When hiring, we've benefited hugely from case studies from other companies. Our mode of operation has been learning as much as we can, borrowing what we need at the time and dropping practices that just aren't working out for us.

In this piece I'll describe the strategies that have stuck with Edurio, in the hope that some of these will be useful to you. I'll start by describing our core assumptions that drove our thinking, and then explain our process from receiving a CV to making a decision. In each step, I will explain the rationale for having it around ("Why?"), the way we do it ("How?"), how we organise the work ("Who?") and what works best for candidates ("How to perform well?").

## Core assumptions about hiring

First, the recruitment process needs to get a good signal to noise ratio, in order not to waste your time and the candidate's time. Time is the most valuable resource for a young company, so try and get as much as you can out of it. Famously, [Google cut back its number of interviews from 12+ to 4](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/google-rule-of-four/), as additional information did not lead to substantially different hiring / not-hiring decisions.

Second, for startups, the culture generally matters more than the experience of the candidate. If the company has not reached product-market fit yet, the jobs will be a minimum viable product as much as the technology. That mean's they're bound to change â€” and it is ideal if your new hire is a good fit and able to change with the company.

<aside> ðŸ‘ˆ I've borrowed the "Jobs as a Product" metaphor from [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag/status/1428813307557945354) where @patrick_oshag lists traits of companies he appreciates.

Third, hiring is a wicked problem. It is characterised by having high-stakes decisions, poor and slow feedback, and no clear indications of success. Doing more of it does not mean you will get better at it. Interviewing and each separate step in the hiring process, however, is a much more kind problem with much more immediate feedback â€” you can reflect on the quality of your call notes or the interesting observations from an interview â€” so it is easier to deliberately practice and get better at that.

Finally, we're likely to adapt the process for exceptions. If somebody's been coming to our board game events and talking education for ages, the conversation is likely going to go a different route. If we've collaborated before as contractors, we already know what your work outputs are so we'd skip the task stage.
