## The Experience


## How?
Here's what I've found useful so far:
- Running this in Roll20 VTT using the "Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition" character sheets by Daniel HolmbÃ¤ck and Joshua Arnold.
- Using the Beginner Game as a well-paced tutorial (via DriveThruRPG), but generating new characters instead of using the pregenerated ones. Also, adding an intrigue conflict scene at the end of the adventure.
- Useful tools (in particular a list of Demeanours) here: https://craneclan.weebly.com/rpg-tools.html
