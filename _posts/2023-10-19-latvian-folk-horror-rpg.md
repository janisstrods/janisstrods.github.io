* *Tumultuous background* â€”Â the 19th century, as explored in Vaesen, is already filled with social pressures. The emergence of industrial cities leading to a clash between the modern and the traditional worldviews is a strong catalyst for action. Add to that the national identity questions of 19th century Latvia â€” the ruling forces of tsarist Russia, the German landlords, the Latvian serfs â€”Â and you have yourself an excellent background for an RPG.
* *Unexplored beasties* â€” in addition to the familiar ghosts, gnomes, witches, and werewolves, the Latvian folk stories are filled with lesser known creatures: the *vadatajs* lures travellers into bogs, the *sumpurnis* is a cannibal humanoid with a dog's face, and the local minor deities like the *Wind Mother* have their own games to play.
* *Rich archives to explore* â€” the Latvian National Library is filled with maps, early photographs, and drawings of the period that can enrich the setting.
