# About me
Here's me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janisstrods/). Here's me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/janisstrods).

I am very proud to be a generalist founder of [Edurio, an edtech startup](https://home.edurio.com)), where I am currently focusing on commercial operations (having done customer success, product, data analysis, and research previously).

I also play a lot of games â€” video games, board games, table-top role-playing games.
