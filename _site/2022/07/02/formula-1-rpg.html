<p>I’ve been watching the Drive to Survive F1 docuseries these days while quarantining with the old C-19, and it feels like a perfect background for a role playing game. Change the motorsport to a spell-casting competition, a series of legendary obstacle-courses, a competition to get the best trade deal (or just keep the vehicle in there), and you have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exciting session-to-session dynamics — each week is centered around a race in a brand new exotic location. There is a lot of politicking / intrigue / preparation / mishaps before the race; then there’s the race (an action packed sequence); then an unwind after the race.</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>A clear campaign dynamic — the season has a clear goal for teams: the top teams fighting for first place, the mid-fielders trying to manoeuvre themselves into a promising position, the underdogs pushing forwards against all odds.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>A steady set of colourful characters — team principals / managers with something to prove, owners investing millions, a bunch of flamboyant pilot divas (competing between teams and between each other), a supporting team of mechanics, engineers, and researchers, oligarchs looking for a team for their ultra-wealthy children, etc. etc.. Add into the mix unique NPCs in every new locale, and you have the fixings for good drama.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Opportunity for fresh new mechanics — would be an interesting game design challenge to simulate the race (beyond a single die roll) and the impact that pre-race decisions have on the race. Opportunity to go anywhere on the spectrum from theatre-of-the-mind to a full-on track with minis.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
