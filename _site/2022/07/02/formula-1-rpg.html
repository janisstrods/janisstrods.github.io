<h1 id="idea-a-formula-1-rpg">Idea: A Formula 1 RPG?</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve been watching the Drive to Survive F1 docuseries these days while quarantining with the old C-19, and it feels like a perfect background for a role playing game.</p>

<p>Change the motorsport to a spell-casting competition, a series of legendary obstacle-courses, a competition to get the best trade deal (or just keep the vehicle in there), and we have a game with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Exciting session-to-session dynamics</em> â€” each week is centered around a race in a brand new exotic location. There is a lot of politicking / intrigue / preparation / mishaps before the race; then thereâ€™s the race (an action packed sequence); then an unwind after the race.</li>
  <li><em>A clear campaign arc</em> â€” the season has a clear goal for teams: the top teams fighting for first place, the mid-fielders trying to manoeuvre themselves into a promising position, the underdogs pushing forwards against all odds.</li>
  <li><em>A stable of colourful characters</em> â€”Â team principals / managers with something to prove, owners investing millions, a bunch of flamboyant pilot divas (competing between teams and between each other), a supporting team of mechanics, engineers, and researchers, oligarchs looking for a team for their ultra-wealthy children, etc. etc.. Add into the mix unique NPCs in every new locale, and you have the fixings for good drama.</li>
  <li><em>Opportunity for fresh game mechanics</em> â€” would be an interesting game design challenge to simulate the race (beyond a single die roll) and the impact that pre-race decisions have on the race. Opportunity to go anywhere on the spectrum from theatre-of-the-mind to a full-on track with minis.</li>
</ul>
